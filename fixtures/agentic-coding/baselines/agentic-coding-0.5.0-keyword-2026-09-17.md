## keyword — gate PASSED (positive top-3 100.0% vs fixture minimum 90.0%)

- Positive queries: top-1 96.0% (100 queries), top-3 100.0%
- Neighbor queries: expected selected top-1 62.1% (66 queries), in top-3 90.9%, trap top-1 (query selects the Practice it resembles) 19.7%

Most confused neighbor selections (queries worded near 'resembles' that selected 'actual top-1' instead of the expected neighbor):

| resembles | actual top-1 selection | count |

| `requirements.ground-user-goal` | `requirements.ground-user-goal` | 1 |
| `requirements.define-acceptance-and-non-goals` | `requirements.define-acceptance-and-non-goals` | 1 |

Regression vs baseline: 165 common queries, 0 lost hits, 12 gained hits.

> Evaluation-only evidence: observed retrieval selection for the fixture queries on one machine and one Pack revision. It is not a claim about content quality, other queries, other modes that were unavailable, or downstream Agent behavior.
