# Sources and provenance

This Pack generalizes public Lorelum research and sanitized engineering retrospectives into tool-neutral Practices. It does not reproduce repository-local paths, credentials, private identifiers, proprietary evaluation material, or tool-specific operating instructions.

## Evidence labels

- **Issue-explicit** means the linked public issue directly states the failure mode, desired behavior, or candidate Practice.
- **Issue-derived synthesis** means the Practice is an author generalization from a public issue's case or boundary, rather than a direct claim made by the issue.
- **Registry/install synthesis** means the Practice was generalized from a sanitized maintainer retrospective about Registry and installation implementation. The public Practice retains only transferable engineering judgment.
- **Review-workflow synthesis** means the Practice was generalized from a redacted development-review workflow. Private artifacts and tool-specific procedures are intentionally not published.
- **Delegation/Pack-authoring synthesis** means the Practice was generalized from a sanitized Pack-authoring workflow where delegated work repeated a rejected interpretation because the deciding conversation context was absent. Private prompts, identities, and repository-local operating details are not published.
- **Defensive-complexity synthesis** means the Practice was generalized from sanitized maintainer feedback about agents adding repeated validation, normalization, authorization, or fallback behavior through ordinary development.

| `agentic-coding.planning.decide-scope-and-stop-conditions`            | Issue-explicit: #35; Issue-derived synthesis: #35; Registry/install synthesis | The issue explicitly separates required, optional, and out-of-scope work and rejects future value as sufficient current justification; the finish, defer, and replan boundary generalizes preventing implementation opportunities from extending accepted work. Merges the former `admit-only-currently-justified-work` and `define-stop-condition` rows (0.5.0). |

| `agentic-coding.implementation.inspect-and-reuse-existing-capability` | Registry/install synthesis                                   | A sanitized retrospective showed that runtime, dependency, or local capabilities should be checked before duplicating behavior.                                                 |
| `agentic-coding.implementation.limit-investigation-to-current-decision` | Issue-derived synthesis: packs #9; Delegation/Pack-authoring synthesis | #9 identifies context waste from indiscriminate loading; this Practice generalizes the boundary across code, tests, configuration, documents, and logs without prescribing a host or retrieval mechanism. |

| `agentic-coding.implementation.confirm-product-surface-expansion`     | Issue-derived synthesis: #35; Registry/install synthesis     | The issue rejects unsupported features and extension points; the narrow public-surface check generalizes the Registry case.                                                     |
| `agentic-coding.implementation.choose-smallest-sufficient-design`     | Registry/install synthesis                                   | A sanitized retrospective supports choosing the smallest design that satisfies current requirements and invariants without duplicate layers or I/O.                             |
| `agentic-coding.implementation.preserve-responsibility-boundaries`    | Issue-derived synthesis: #28                                 | The issue's domain-model failure demonstrates that technically valid code can violate the component or domain that owns the invariant.                                          |

## Synthesis boundary

The `0.5.0` revision (lorelum-packs #19) is editorial: knowledge sources are unchanged. Every
Guidance was rewritten as an ordered decision procedure with an explicit stop, `applies_when` was
reworded to discriminate neighbors using the #17 keyword baseline's confusion matrix, and examples
were made self-contained for a cold reader. The former `admit-only-currently-justified-work` and
`define-stop-condition` Practices were merged into `decide-scope-and-stop-conditions` because
admission labeling and finish/defer/replan boundaries occur at the same pre-work scope decision;
the merged provenance row above preserves both original labels. Severity was tiered for the first
time — critical for evidence-and-delivery honesty, warn for scope and planning, info for
conventions — which is author synthesis with no external source.

The `0.4.0` additions `agentic-coding.implementation.validate-at-the-owning-boundary` and
`agentic-coding.implementation.make-recovery-behavior-explicit` are **Defensive-complexity synthesis**:
sanitized maintainer feedback about agents repeating validation, normalization, authorization, and
fallbacks throughout ordinary development. The two decisions concern the owner of an established
fact and the semantics of recovery after failure. Security is one application, not their scope.
HTTP/import/domain/database and cache/retry examples are author-constructed composite scenarios,
not claims of incidents or measurements in those systems.

The same synthesis refines `define-acceptance-and-non-goals`, `admit-only-currently-justified-work`,
`scale-work-to-risk-and-cost`, `choose-smallest-sufficient-design`,
`preserve-responsibility-boundaries`, `run-subtractive-review-before-commit`, and
`assert-observable-behavior`. Their original provenance above still applies; the new distinctions
about repeated internal checks, bounded uncertainty, false success, and safeguard costs are author
synthesis rather than quotations from those issues. The generic local-stop example illustrates
recovery prerequisites and makes no claim that all process identity or compatibility checks are
unnecessary.

The candidate's fixtures state contrasting selection and behavior hypotheses for typed internal
handoffs, independent ingress, concurrent writes, enforced and bypassable gateways, stale cache,
nested retries, and local stop. Structural validation and semantic author review do not establish
retrieval quality or measured downstream Agent improvement; those evaluations remain unrun.

The mapping records provenance, not empirical proof that retrieval improves task outcomes. The public fixtures provide testable hypotheses for retrieval and behavior evaluation. Benchmark or scoring methods, private artifacts, and unpublished review procedures are outside this repository.

`fixtures/agentic-coding/queries.yaml` turns those hypotheses into a runnable retrieval query set (three positive and two neighbor queries per Practice, expected selections declared before the run, wording held away from Practice text). Recorded runs under `fixtures/agentic-coding/baselines/` report observed selection only — keyword mode plus, where the semantic index builds on that machine, semantic mode; a degraded semantic run is annotated with its failure code rather than reported as a result.
